However, these NPCs occasionally get their event-log saved, reset, and re-deployed. Data generated by an NPC during its lifespan is called the 'event-log.'"

    "content": "HeptaHeads are unique NPCs of the simulation world 'Proxima', every Heptahead is assigned with key attributes like unique ID, name, unique pixelated avatar, gender, and role in the simulation. Besides their avatar, Heptaheads do not have any other graphical feature. NPCs interact with each other within a region called an organisation to generate event logs. After the lifespan (deployment period), HeptaHeads are reset and redeployed with blank event logs. A replacement is made when the logs don't get adequately reset, which is an infrequent and unexplained event. Records of every replaced HeptaHead will be maintained and published on the Proxima Weblog."
